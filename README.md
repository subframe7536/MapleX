# Maple Mono

Maple Mono is an open source monospace font focused on smoothing your coding experience.

I create it to enhance my working experience, and hope that it can be useful to others.

## Features

- ✨ Variable - Infinity font weights with fine-grained italic glyphs.
- ☁️ Smooth - Round corner, brand-new glyph of `@ $ % & Q ->` and cursive `f i j k l x y` in italic style.
- 💪 Useful - Large amount of smart ligatures, see in [`features/`](./source/features/README.md)
- 🎨 Icon - First-Class [Nerd-Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) support, make your terminal more vivid.
- 🔨 Customize - Enable or disable font features as you want, just make your own font.

## Build

Clone the repo and run on your local machine. Make sure you have `python3` and `pip` installed

```shell
git clone https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font --depth 1 -b variable
pip install foundrytools-cli
python build.py
```

- For `Ubuntu` or `Debian`, maybe `python-is-python3` is needed as well

If you have trouble installing the dependencies, just create a new Github codespace on `variable` branch and run the commands there

### Customize

You can change build config in `config.json`

- There is `--normal` option in `build.py` for common config, just like `JetBrains Mono` (with slashed zero)
- For custom `font-patcher` args, `font-forge` (and maybe `python3-fontforge` as well) is needed

#### Font Feature Freeze Options

- `enable`: Move ligature rules to `calt`, which will enable the features without setting up `cvXX` / `ssXX` / `zero` in font features config, just as default ligatures
- `disable`: Remove the features in `cvXX` / `ssXX` / `zero`, which will no longer effect, even if you enable it manually
- `ignore`: Do nothing

### Chinese version

Run `python build.py --cn`, the CN base fonts (about 135 MB) will download from remote.

If you want to build CN base fonts from variable (about 35 MB), setup `"cn.use_static_base_font": false` in [config.json](./config.json) and **BE PATIENT**, instantiation will take about 40-50 minutes.

#### Notice

The build script will auto download neccessory assets from GitHub. If you have trouble downloading, please setup `github_mirror` in `config.json` or `$GITHUB` to your environment variable. (Target URL will be `https://{github_mirror}/<user>/<repo>/releases/download/{tag}/{file}`)

### Build Script Options
