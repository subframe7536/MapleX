## Build

clone the repo and run in your local machine. Make sure you have `python3` and `pip` installed

```shell
git clone https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font --depth 1 -b variable
pip install foundrytools-cli
python build.py
```

- for `Ubuntu` or `Debian`, maybe `python-is-python3` is needed as well

If you have trouble to install the dependencies, just create a new Github codespace on `variable` branch and run the commands there

### Customize

You can change build config in `config.json`

- There is `--normal` option in `build.py` for common config, just like `Jetbrains Mono` (with slashed zero)
- For custom `font-patcher` args, `font-forge` (and maybe `python3-fontforge` as well) is needed

### Chinese version

1. Download CN base font at [Gitee release](https://gitee.com/subframe7536/Maple/releases/tag/v7.0-beta23)
2. put them into `./source/cn`
3. run `build.py` and **BE PATIENT**, instantiation will take about 30 minutes

### Release Build

```sh
python build.py --release
```
